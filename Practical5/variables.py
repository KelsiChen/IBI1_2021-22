# 3.2 Booleans
X = input()
Y = input()
# input 2 boolean values X and Y
W = X and Y
# set the boolean value of W
print (W)
# output the answer
# When I input X = True, Y = True, W is True.
# When I input X = True, Y = False, W is False.
# When I input X = False, Y = False, W is False.
# When I input X = False, Y = True, W is False.
# The results meet the principle of booleans in python.
