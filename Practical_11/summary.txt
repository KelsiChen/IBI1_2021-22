There exists high similarities between the human sample and the mouse sample.\
There exists low similarities between the human sample and the random sample.\
There exists low similarities between the mouse sample and the random sample.\
\
The similarities of amino acid sequences between human sample and mouse sample may indicate that human and mouse have a same ancestor thousands of years ago. \
Because of the high similarities, we can use mouse as an important living experimental subject to substitute human body. Instead of testing on our human body directly, we can inject new drugs into mice to test their side effects.
