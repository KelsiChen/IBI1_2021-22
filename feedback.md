Week 4

There is nothing needed to change.



Week 5

Problem 1: Week 5 practical is not within the IBI1_2021-22 directory. 
Solution: The repository ‘Practical-5’, ‘Practical-6’ and ‘Practical-7’ have been deleted, and contents within them have been transported to the folders with same names in IBI1_2021-22 repository.

Problem 2: The result of the Triangle sequence (1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55) only print the last value. 
Solution: A necessary tab has been added before the code of printing sums



Week 6

Problem 1: In the Paternal_age program, scatter plot showing the data input was not displayed.
Solution: Add the code of showing the well-labelled scatter plot.

Problem 2: In the Paternal_age program, the variable for age that can be modified and will return the correct risk of cardiovascular health in the offspring was missing. 
Solution: The current dictionary of paternal ages and their corresponding value in chd had been deleted and changed into two separated arrays. Therefore, these two lists could be easily and flexibly changed to satisfy different needs. Also, an input of the random paternal age is written, which could then find the corresponding value in the index "chd", then print the correct risk of cardiovascular health in the offspring.

Problem 3: In the List_manipulation program, the sorted list of marks did not be printed.
Solution: codes to sort and printed the values in the list ‘marks’ have been added.

Problem 4: In the List_manipulation program, the displayed boxplot neglected the labels of both x axis and the title. 
Solution: Codes which could labelling the x axis and the title have been added.
